# Studious



# Description

`Studious` as a solution comprises our team's response to the current shift towards online education due to the aggravating effects of the COVID19 epidemic. Although considered a short-term replacement for the more traditional schools, we thoroughly believe there is a pack of opportunities left for the prospect of online schooling. From our perspective this is where Studious fits in, we would like to develop an entire integrated solution to offer professors and students alike the means to make learning and studying online easy and agreeable. 



# Our goals

A list of the end goals we think is in order. We stated broadly, previously, our intention but here are a few of the great things we are challenging ourselves to achieve : 

 - **Fully integrated platform**, we wish that our clients would also rely on external services that they love and are familiar with, but throughout our platform ( e.g integration with Google Calendar).
 - **Ease of use**, our prime intention is to **Make Learning Great Again**! which shouldn't be a metric for how tech worthy you are to make use of the platform, every user should benefit equally whether they are sysadmins or students of the great things we have to offer.
 - **Scalability**, our platform should be undeniably capable to handle hundreds if not thousands of concurrent users.
 - **Portability**, our users shouldn't be denied whether they are on iOS, Android or Windows, **Everyone is Welcomed !**
